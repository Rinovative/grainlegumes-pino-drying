"""
Protect atomic checkpoint publication when serialization fails mid-write.

Injected writer failures prove an existing destination remains byte-identical and
a first publication leaves neither final nor temporary files. Checkpoint schema,
roles, and resume-state equivalence are covered by ``test_checkpoint_resume``.
this module isolates only the filesystem transaction.
