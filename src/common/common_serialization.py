common_serialization.py
===============================================================================
Publish authoritative files atomically and compute stable content digests.

Responsibilities:
  - Write unique sibling temporary files and atomically replace destinations
  - Flush file data and parent-directory metadata where the platform supports it
  - Remove unpublished temporary files after handled failures
  - Provide canonical JSON and file SHA-256 helpers for lifecycle identities

Design principles:
  - A failed publication never damages the previously published destination
  - Same-directory temporary files keep replacement on one filesystem
  - Callers decide whether replacement is permitted by their lifecycle contract

This module does NOT:
  - Enforce checkpoint, experiment, dataset, or artifact schemas
  - Refuse overwrite of an existing destination on the caller's behalf
  - Turn several independently published files into one transaction
