common_locking.py
===============================================================================
Coordinate exclusive filesystem writers with process-scoped advisory locks.

Responsibilities:
  - Acquire re-entrant exclusive locks on persistent lock files
  - Support blocking serialization and fail-fast writer leases
  - Release locks automatically on exceptions and process exit
  - Close inherited lock descriptors in forked child processes

Design principles:
  - Lock files live outside any target directory a caller may delete
  - Kernel-owned locks, rather than file existence, define lease ownership
  - Re-entrancy is limited to the owning process thread and exact lock path

This module does NOT:
  - Delete persistent lock files or infer ownership from their existence
  - Coordinate threads through an in-memory mutex in place of a kernel lock
  - Make a multi-file operation transactional beyond the caller-held context

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : Path | str
        Persistent lock-file path. Its parent directory is created.
    blocking : bool
        Wait for the current owner when true. Fail immediately when false.

    ------
    FileLockUnavailableError
