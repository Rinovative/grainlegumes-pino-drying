"""
experiments_run.py

Allocate, initialize, execute, resume, and validate saved experiment runs.

Responsibilities:
  - Allocate fresh run leaves exclusively and transition explicit statuses
  - Derive stable labeled seeds and configure deterministic execution early
  - Persist immutable run inputs and mutable lifecycle outputs atomically
  - Enforce allowed resume config changes and exact last-checkpoint continuation
  - Validate the completed/loadable contract consumed by inference and artifacts

Design principles:
  - Only explicit resume may open an existing run directory
  - Config, split, and normalizer artifacts are immutable after fresh creation
  - Best and last checkpoints have distinct enforced lifecycle roles
  - Generic orchestration consumes task/config interfaces without field names

This module does NOT:
  - Define task physics, model architectures, loss formulas, or metric mathematics
  - Infer resume from an existing directory or treat observers as authoritative state
  - Render or publish post-training analysis artifacts

    Execute a prepared fresh or resume run under its exclusive writer lease.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : dict[str, Any]
        Fully resolved runtime config. On resume this may extend duration and
        change runtime-only device policy while preserving saved science.
    run_dir : pathlib.Path
        Already initialized run leaf whose lifecycle this call exclusively owns.
    persisted_config : Mapping[str, Any] | None, optional
        Immutable saved config used for checkpoint identity. Defaults to
        ``config`` for fresh execution.
    saved_split_indices : dict[str, Any] | None, optional
        Admitted saved membership reused during explicit resume.
    restored_data_processor : Any | None, optional
        Processor reconstructed from the saved normalizer for explicit resume.
    resume_from : pathlib.Path | None, optional
        Validated ``last_checkpoint.pt`` continuation source. ``None`` starts a
        fresh training state.
    epoch_end_callback : Callable[[int, dict[str, float]], None] | None, optional
        Local authoritative callback invoked after every completed epoch,
        before the optional tracking observer. Evaluation keys follow cadence.
    summary_extra : Mapping[str, Any] | None, optional
        Caller-owned facts merged into lifecycle publications.
    device_resolution : learning.device.DeviceResolution
        Concrete service-resolved device and serializable runtime metadata.
    terminal_status_resolver : Callable[[BaseException], str | None] | None, optional
        Optional caller-owned classifier for terminal trial outcomes. The returned
        status must be an admitted run terminal status.

    Returns
    -------
    dict[str, Any]
        Completed training result with objective, history, and checkpoint facts.

    Raises
    ------
    RunLifecycleError
        If the writer lease, saved data, checkpoint identity, objective result,
        or lifecycle transition violates the admitted run contract.
    BaseException
        Runtime construction, training, interruption, and required tracking
        failures are re-raised after best-effort failed/interrupted publication.

    Notes
    -----
    Fresh execution atomically publishes split and normalizer state before model
    construction. Resume reuses those immutable artifacts and restores only the
    last checkpoint. The best checkpoint remains the selected inference source.
    Local summary/checkpoint publication is authoritative. Any failure in an
    explicitly requested online or offline W&B session follows the tracking
    contract and propagates.

    This is a lower-level service for callers that already prepared lifecycle
    state. Normal CLI/notebook launches should prefer :func:`run_experiment`.

    Resolve and execute a fresh or explicit-resume experiment.

    Config, requested device, concrete device, and mixed-precision requirements
    are validated before fresh output allocation. Resume acquires the run writer
    lease before reading mutable lifecycle artifacts and restores only the
    identity-validated last checkpoint.

    Parameters
    ----------
    requested : dict[str, Any]
        Fully resolved ordinary single-run configuration.
    config_path : pathlib.Path | str
        Semantic request source used only for lifecycle diagnostics.
    device_resolution : learning.device.DeviceResolution | None, optional
        Pre-resolved concrete device shared by a higher-level sequencer when supplied.
    resume : pathlib.Path | str | None, optional
        Existing run directory explicitly continued from ``last_checkpoint.pt``.
        ``None`` requires exclusive allocation of a new run leaf.
    output_root : pathlib.Path | str | None, optional
        Fresh-run destination override. On resume it must resolve to the exact
        saved task/run leaf. Dataset roots remain unchanged.

    Returns
    -------
    dict[str, Any]
        Exact ``run_dir``, completed training-loop ``result``, and the immutable
        ``device_resolution`` used by training.

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError
        If the YAML, explicit resume leaf, or a required resume artifact is absent.
    FileExistsError
        If a fresh destination already exists. Reopening requires ``resume``.
    config_loader.ConfigError
        If YAML or an override violates the semantic experiment schema.
    learning.device.DeviceResolutionError
        If runtime policy is invalid, strict CUDA is unusable, or mixed precision
        is incompatible with the resolved device.
    RunLifecycleError
        If a writer lease is active or saved status, data, checkpoint identity,
        best/last roles, or lifecycle history is not resumable.
    ValueError
        If requested science differs from the saved config, terminal duration
        does not extend progress, or an output-root override identifies another leaf.

    Notes
    -----
    Fresh execution allocates first, publishes immutable config/split/normalizer
    inputs, then trains under one writer lease. Resume preserves those inputs,
    permits only continuation-safe runtime/duration changes, and validates best
    versus last checkpoint roles before mutation. ``best_checkpoint.pt`` remains
    the inference/artifact source. ``last_checkpoint.pt`` is the sole continuation
    source.

    Training or admission failures publish failed/interrupted state best-effort
    before the original exception propagates. Local lifecycle files remain
    authoritative, while any failure in an explicitly requested online or offline
    W&B session fails the operation after durable local evidence is published.
