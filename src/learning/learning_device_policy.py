learning_device_policy.py
===============================================================================
Define the dependency-free runtime-device policy vocabulary.

Responsibilities:
  - Publish the exact auto, cuda, and cpu policy literals
  - Validate user-facing policy values with path-qualified errors
  - Keep parser construction and semantic config validation backend-free

Design principles:
  - Policy vocabulary is distinct from hardware resolution
  - Validation is exact, deterministic, and free of runtime probing
  - Torch is imported only by the concrete device resolver

This module does NOT:
  - Query CUDA or construct Torch devices. ``learning_device`` owns resolution
  - Parse CLI arguments or config files. Their boundary modules own parsing
  - Persist runtime metadata or select mixed-precision behavior
